* It begins with the initiation of new transaction request which can arise from any node in the network.  
* This transaction request is then broadcasted throughout the network and it gets picked up by various minors who are part of that network. 
* Each Minor picks up the transaction and runs some computation in order to validate the transaction. 
* Once validated, this transaction gets added to the block and new block is created which in turn is added to the blockchain. 
* This is how a new transaction is completed
